Defnet Network Engine
=====================

Welcome to the Defnet Network Engine source code!

Here you can get an proof of concept of network engine for Defold game engine (http://defold.com)


Getting up and running
----------------------

The steps below will take you through cloning your own private fork and running the example game by yourself:

1. Clone this repo with your favourite tool.

1. Go to folder "defnet/server", execute command "gradlew clean run" and wait for the string "Server : Launched on /127.0.0.1:8282"

1. Register at http://defold.com and download defold editor.

1. Add new project from your defold dashboard and open it with editor.

1. Replace content of your project with content from cloned git repository "defnet/client".

1. Try build and run it - you should see text "Start match" on a black screen. Launch the second instance of game (just build and run it once more).

1. Now you can press "Start match" on both clients and have fun! )


Additional Notes
----------------

Remember, that it's just a proof of concept and doesn't supposed to be used in any real project. It has been made just for fun and it's not going to be maintained in future.
